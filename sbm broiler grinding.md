Broiler Feeding: Mash or Pellet Meadow Feeds Grinders with hammers are more often used.Grinding is achieved both by contact between feed particles and the hammers and the abrasive effect of the grills,Thus grinding control depends upon two main factors: hammer peripheral speed,and grili mesh size and the percentage of holes. Feed particle size: Implications on the. A more developed gizzard is associated with increased grinding activity,resulting in increased gut motility and greater digestion of nutrients.Although grinding to fine particle size is thought to improve pellet quality,it will markedly increase energy consumption during milling.
