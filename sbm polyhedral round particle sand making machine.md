Materials Science and Engineering The 2nd Annual 2016 International Workshop on Materials Science and Engineering (IWMSE 2016) was held in Guangzhou,Guangdong,China on August 12 Aug.The main aim of IWMSE 2016 was to provide a platform for scientists and engineers,to get together to share their research findings,exchange ideas and identify the future. Filling of Irregular Channels with Round Cross Section. The filling of channels in porous media with particles of a material can be interpreted in a first approximation as a packing of spheres in cylindrical recipients.Numerous studies on micro and nanoscopic scales show that they are,as a rule,not ideal cylinders.In this paper,the channels,which have an irregular shape and a circular cross section,as well as the packing algorithms are.

Manufacturing Routes for Metallic Foams Figure 1 provides an overview of the methods available for making metal foams.1 One distinguishing factor is whether molten metal or metal powder is used (although the actual foaming always takes place in the liquid state).A second difference is the gas source used for creating porosity: an external source can be used,a blowing agent can be decomposed in situ,or dissolved gas can be forced.
