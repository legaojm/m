Downstream Effects Of Cave Fragmentation Since the 1990s,‘mine to mill’ studies have evaluated the impact of blast fragmentation on downstream plant throughput.This was because crushing and grinding circuits (in particular,SAG mills) are sensitive to feed size and the amount of fines generated from blasting.Significant gains in grinding circuit efficiency could be achieved by controlling and optimising blast fragmentation. Autogenous mill and semi autogenous mill While AG mills operate without a ball charge,SAG mills use a grinding media charge of normally 3 % 12 % for comminuting the feed material.The maximum feed size is between 200 mm and 500 mm.The AG SAG mill is normally installed upstream of a tube mill operating in closed circuit with hydrocyclones.
