What is Aggregate Planning ? Aggregate Planning Production and Operations Management 15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete is considered as a chemically combined mass where the inert material acts as a filler and the binding materials act as a binder.The most important binding materials are cement and lime.Inert materials used in concrete are termed as aggregates.Most common aggregates are sand,brick chips,stone chips,gravel,shells,etc.The concrete plays a very important role in all branches of. Arsenic in bedrock,soil and groundwater — The first.
