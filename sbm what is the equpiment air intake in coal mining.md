Ventilation Gas Control Introduction underground COAL Ventilation Gas Control The ability to provide adequate ventilation to a longwall panel can be a major factor in the success of an installation,especially in gassy conditions Most gassy mines now use some degree of gas pre drainage of the seam being worked which greatly reduces the gas to be dealt with during longwall extraction Underground Mine Ventilation Oct 25,2016&#0183;&#32;In general a ventilation system seeks to direct air in the mine through an entry shaft or tunnel called the intake side and direct it back to the surface via a different path called the return side Air flows in response to differences in pressure which for underground mines are generated by primary fans situated at the surface UNDERGROUND VENTILATION (METALLIFERROUS MINES), paths from the primary fresh air intakes through operating areas to return airways connecting to exhaust rises and shafts In general terms the shorter and more direct the ventilation circuit through each working area,the better the system Maximum use of parallel paths will reduce the overall mine resistance for a given air Appendix F: Underground Coal Mining Methods and.
