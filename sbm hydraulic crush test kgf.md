How to Convert a Load to PSI in a Tensile Test … A tensile test involves the elongation of a material by a pulling force known as the load.Generally,the distance the material stretches is directly proportional to the load applied.These tests give insight into the usefulness and safety of various materials in construction and engineering applications.The pressure exerted on the material. Mechanical Testing Hertz Testing and Training Centre 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The crush test,sometimes referred to as an upsetting test,is usually made on boiler and other pressure tubes,for evaluating ductility.The specimen is a ring cut from the tube,placed on end and crushed endwise by press to the distance prescribed by the applicable material specifications. Tester machines and Instruments of Packing &amp; … 6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A test piece placed over a circular elastic diaphragm,it is rigidly clamped at the periphery but free to bulge with the diaphragm.Hydraulic fluid is pumped at a constant rate,and bulged the diaphragm until the test piece ruptures. How to Calculate Hydraulic Press Force in Tons … To calculate hydraulic press force,first find piston area from piston diameter.Then multiply the pressure in psi by cylinder area in inches.Divide force in pounds by 2,000 to get force in tons.Gather the Data.Reference the necessary data,such as psi and cylinder piston diameter or area.Look for this information in the hydraulic press's. 320D D L Series 2 4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hydraulic system pressure is 35 000 kPa (5,076 psi) with 202 L min (53.36 gal min) flow from each of the two hydraulic.Standard hydraulic test ports enable a service technician to.to crush,pulverize,and perform a variety of specialized cutting tasks such as cutting steel rebar and tanks.Shear. &lt;1217&gt; TABLET BREAKING FORCE Another measure of the mechanical integrity of tablets is their breaking force,which is the force required to cause them to fail (i.e.break) in a specific plane.The tablets are generally placed between two platens,one of which moves to apply sufficient force to the tablet to cause fracture.
