What Is Magnetic Flux? (with picture) 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetic flux is the quantity of magnetic field that penetrates an area at right angles to it.In a simple situation where the field passes at right angles through a flat surface,this quantity is the strength of the magnetic field multiplied by the area of the surface.In most real life situations. Numerical Experiments on the Two step Emergence. We present the new results of the two dimensional numerical experiments on the cross sectional evolution of a twisted magnetic flux tube rising from the deeper solar convection zone (,000 km) to the corona through the surface.The initial depth is 10 times deeper than most of the previous calculations focusing on the flux emergence from the uppermost convection zone.
