Clinker (cement) Wikipedia 2019102&ensp&#0183&enspIn the manufacture of Portland cement,clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter,produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilie materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage. Clinker cooler level and pressure measurement VEGA To produce cement,the raw meal is burned to clinker in a long rotary kiln.After leaving the rotary kiln,the clinker has a temperature of up to +1300 &#176C and must be cooled down to a temperature of about +200 &#176C for further storage.To achieve this,the clinker bed is cooled with a continuous stream of air. The cement kiln Understanding Cement Manufacturing the cement kiln.Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln.Basically,this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two.The axis is inclined at a slight angle,the end with the burner being lower. Clinker coolers skf Much like the rotary kilns that feed them,clinker coolers are subject to extremely high operating temperatures and dust levels.Bearings on the cooler grates have to operate at low speeds,under moderate to high loads.
