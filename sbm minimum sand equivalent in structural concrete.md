Composition &amp; Types of Concrete 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What is Concrete? Concrete,an artificial stone like mass,is the composite material that is created by mixing binding material (cement or lime) along with the aggregate (sand,gravel,stone,brick chips,etc.),water,admixtures,etc in specific proportions.The strength and quality are dependent on the mixing proportions.
