Cement Manufacturing Process 5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Stage of Cement Manufacture.There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process.Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction Quarry.The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium),sand and clay (silicon,aluminum,iron),shale,fly ash,mill scale and bauxite.The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches. Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of. Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement.At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes,Dry Process,and Wet Process.The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process,calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry state. Process Costing Process Costing enables the ascertainment of cost of the product at each process or stage of manufacture.The following features may be identified with process costing: The output consists of products which are homogenous.Production is carried on in different stages (each of which is called a process) having a continuous flow. What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes. The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material,such as limestone,clay or iron ore,in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln,whereas no water is added in the dry process.
