Surface grinding Surface grinding is used to produce a smooth finish on flat surfaces.It is a widely used abrasive machining process in which a spinning wheel covered in rough particles (grinding wheel) cuts chips of metallic or nonmetallic substance from a workpiece,making a face of it flat or smooth.This is machine also used in many industries to surface grinding. Milling (machining) Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material[1] by advancing a cutter into a work piece.This may be done varying direction[2] on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.[3] Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty. Precision Grinding Perform The grinding attachment is arranged on the grinding head so that the axis of the grinding wheel is in a horizontal orientation,the grinding wheel does not perform planetary motion and only reciprocates up and down,and grinding similar to the insertion type can be.
