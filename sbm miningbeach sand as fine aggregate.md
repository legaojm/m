sbm miningbeach sand as fine aggregateEXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON CONCRETE USING SEA SAND AS FINE … the sea sand pumped from a distance of about ten kilometers is very suitable for building construction industry.This study is to experiment the suitability to use beach sea sand as a substitute for river sand as fine aggregate for concrete.Keywords: Concrete Suitability of Crushed Stone Dust as Fine Aggregate in Mortars stone fine aggregate in masonry mortars.Keywords: Crushed stone dust,Mortar,River sand I.INTRODUCTION In India,river sand is used as fine aggregate in mortar over a period of millions of years.In general,the demand of river sand is very high in Use of sea sand as fine aggregate in concrete making Use of sea sand as fine aggregate in concrete making Concrete is a mixture of cement,coarse aggregates,fine aggregates or sand and water Concrete is a mixture of cement,coarse aggregates,fine aggregates or sand and water.The approximate ratios of these Why is sand called a fine aggregate? Thanks for the question.Fine aggregates are those who has the particle size in between 2 mm 4.75 mm.Sand falls in this range and thus its called as fine aggregate.However,Sand can also be classified into 3 parts as,1.Fine sand : Range 0.07.
