What is the compressive strength of M25 concrete at ‚Ä¶ For M25 grade concrete the seven days crushing for site condition shall be not less than 67 % of M25,i.e not less than 16.75 N mm2 But for target strength of M25 for mix design taken i.e for M25.

What is the difference between C30 concrete and M30. &quot;The strength of a concrete mix is measured in grades.There are different concrete grades for example C15,C20,C25.The grade of the concrete means the concrete compression resistance after 28 days.It is done in Newtons per square millimetre.A.
