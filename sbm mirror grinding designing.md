sbm mirror grinding designingCasting a Large,Light Weight Telescope Mirror From. Casting a Large,Light Weight Telescope Mirror From Recycled Glass: The first photo below shows a 12.5 inch diameter,1.5 inch thick,telescope mirror blank,made from recycled glass,that has been lightened by casting the mirror in a mold that made lots of hexagon shaped pockets in the back of the mirror… How mirror is made The tolerances on the mirror will affect the cost and ease with which it can be manufactured.Batch mirror uniformity is the first and fore most job of quality assurance.Mirrors on the edge of a grinding plate or evaporator chamber may not have the same surface or coating as those in the center of the apparatus. An introduction to off axis parabolic mirrors 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;An introduction to off axis parabolic mirrors.OPTI 521 Tutorial.Written by: Kevin Newman.Date: Octo.1.Abstract Off axis parabolic mirrors (OAPs) can be a useful tool in optical design.OAPs combine the achromatic and diffraction limited imaging properties of a parabolic mirror with the ability to deviate the light path low power mirror ore spiral classifier low power mirror ore spiral classifier Spiral Classifier for Mineral ProcessingIn Mineral Processing,the SPIRAL Classifier on the other hand is rotated through the ore.It doesnt lift out of the slurry but is revolved through it.T Mirror Polishing Machine With the help of our expertise,they make sure high level Mirror Polishing Machine by designing our machines with the supreme rigorous quality control measures during each stage of production.Among a mirror finish,any imperfections not addressed in the pre grinding and pre polishing steps will be magnified when the mirror finish is applied. War &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci's Inventions He employed Leonardo as his military architect and engineer for a couple of years during the early 1500s.Leonardo’s War Machines for Cesare Borgia would be both offensive and defensive,from the worlds first machine gun to huge drawbridges and impenetrable fortresses.Other examples of Leonardo’s War machines include the scuba diving gear.

Mike's Telescope Workshop 10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I finally decided it was time to build a machine to help me grind the edges of the blanks true and round.This is my home built edge grinding machine for grinding down my home cast mirror blanks.Click to see the whole project.This is a 12.5 inch diameter,1.5 inch thick,light weight honeycomb back telescope mirror blank that I made myself. Cassegrain formulas. 5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A quick numerical calculation using the mirror spacings for my 12.5&quot; classical Cassegrain indicate that if it were a Dall Kirkham,then moving the secondary toward the primary would require a slightly less corrected primary.So,moving the secondary toward the primary should slightly increase the correction of a Dall Kirkham system in the system. Large Homemade Telescope Making Project 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This web page provides an overview of my large homemade telescope making project.I read several telescope and mirror making books and visited many amateur telescope making or &quot;ATM&quot; websites to learn how to build a 14.5 inch homemade telescope of this size.These sources of information provided many of the techniques I used to make the telescope.
