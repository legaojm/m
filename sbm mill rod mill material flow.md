What is Ball Mill How Many Types of Ball Mills M&amp;C (1) Types on the Basis of Cylinder.1.Short Cylinder Ball Mill: The ball mill with the cylinder length (L) less than 2 times of the cylinder diameter,i.e.the ball mill with L ≤ 2D is short cylinder ball mill,which is usually of single bin structure,mainly used for rough grinding or primary grinding operation,and can realize the wide use of 3 ball mills in series. Rod mills,how they function 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.Rod. 400 years The roots of the Neunkirchen plant reach far back to the year 1593.It is one of the steel locations with the richest history of all and combines history and state of the art production in a unique way. Ball Mills 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.
