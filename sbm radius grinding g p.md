sbm radius grinding g pAn investigation of the surface waviness features of. The surface waviness pattern in Fig.5 was a strait scallop pattern,which could happened only when RSR was integer.However,in practical grinding process,RSR value was mostly non integer and the surface waviness pattern was spiral scallop pattern,as shown in Fig.1 and Fig.6(a).In order to differentiate the surface waviness of integer RSR and non integer RSR,wave shift T θ was utilized.
