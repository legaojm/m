Your question sounds as if you believe we add sulfur to the coal,which is wrong.Sulfur,to some degree,is present in coal naturally.Just as coal is the natural product of organic material stored for long periods of time below ground under heat. Sulfur Coal an overview ScienceDirect Topics SO 2 emissions are dependent upon coal sulphur content,since virtually all coal sulphur is oxidised to SO 2 during combustion (with some SO 3 formation) Power requirements and reagent utilisation within Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) plants is therefore primarily dependent on coal sulphur content Incorporation of elemental sulphur in coal as organic … Organic sulphur can represent over 50% of the total sulphur content in coal 1,but little is known about the nature of this organic sulphur because of the chemical complexity of the coal structure. Glossary Ares Asia Sulphur Sulphur content in coal presents problems with utilization and resultant pollution,as it causes corrosion and fouling of boiler tubes,and atmospheric pollution when released in flue gases. Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal The amount of heat contributed by the combustion of sulfur in coal is relatively small,because the heating value of sulfur is only about 4,000 Btu per pound,and the sulfur content of coal generally averages 1 to 2 percent by weight THE CLEAN USE OF HIGH SULPHUR COAL: AN, The Sulcis coal has particularly high sulphur content and the CFB technology was chosen as being the most adaptable,without the need for external flue gas desulphuration and denitrification Desulfurization of Coal With increasingly stringent environment legislation,coal sulfur content has become one of the most important factors for fuel choice,and the supply of low sulfur coal on the international coal market has increased considerably in recent years.Nevertheless. Where Are the Low Sulphur Content Coal Mines in the US, Indiana Center for Coal Technology Research 12 SULFUR IN COAL Although coal is primarily a mixture of carbon (black) & hydrogen (red) atoms,sulfur atoms (yellow) are also trapped in coal,primarily in two forms In one form,(1) the sulfur is a separate particle often linked with iron (green,pyritic sulfur) with no connection to the carbon.
