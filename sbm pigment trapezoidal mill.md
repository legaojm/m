Subsurface Analysis of Paint Layers While the SE2 mode was used for general imaging,BSD mode was useful for differentiating composition of various paint pigment particles and providing general guidance for EDAX analysis.Darker areas contained more K,Si,and C while brighter areas contained more Ba,S,and Zn for red pigment paint. How to disperse and stabilize pigments After the wetting stage,it is necessary to de aggregate and deagglomerate the pigment particles.This is usually accomplished by mechanical action provided by high impact mill equipment.In the grinding stage,the cohesive forces inside the agglomerates have to be overcome.
