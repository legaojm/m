sbm cement raw meal mill images indiaFCB B mill The ball mill is traditionally the basic system used for the grinding of raw material,clinker and additives in a cement plant,as well as a wide range of minerals.Benefiting from a large experience,the FCB B Mill has been designed to be particularly well adapted for the grinding of products at high fineness and grinding of very abrasive. Clinker quality depends on raw material composition. Portland cement is the most common type of cement in the world.It is used primarily to make concrete,mortar,and grout.Portland cement manufacturing begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay,to a fine powder,called raw meal,which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 &#176;C in a cement kiln.
