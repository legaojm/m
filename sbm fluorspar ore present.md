KGK Company Fluorspar,the name used for fluorite when it is sold as a bulk material or in processed form,is sold in three different grades (acid,ceramic and metallurgical).Acid Grade Fluorspar Acid grade fluorspar is a high purity material used by the chemical industry.It contains over 97% CaF2. Fluorspar in French fluorspar translation in English French dictionary.en (9) It is therefore concluded that,due to the particular and very specific circumstances of the present case,there are currently no reasons to change the form of the measure concerning imports of fluorspar originating in the PRC and the current partial interim review should be terminated without any amendment to the anti dumping measures. By M.Michael Miller 4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;By M.Michael Miller Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Barbara McNair,statistical assistant,and the world production table was prepared by Linder Roberts,international data coordinator.Fluorspar is used directly or indirectly to manufacture such products as aluminum,gasoline,insulating foams,plastics,refrigerants, Fluorite Powder,Fluorite Particles,Fluorite Blocks.
