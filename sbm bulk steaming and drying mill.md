POST HARVESTING PROCESSING dry and hard,it is difficult to break down and requires more energy to convert it into flour.If the grain is too moist,the material sticks to the mill.The optimum moisture content varies between cereal types and with the particular mill being used.Dry grain can be conditioned by soaking in water.Moist grain can be drie d before grinding. Processing and Milling of Parboiled Rice Rice Mill. Processing And Milling Of Parboiled Rice Popularly known as the easy to cook rice,Parboiled rice actually connotes partially boiled rice that is the grain is simmered in the husk.Parboiled rice,thus apparently is a precooked form of rice,but on closer analysis is found to be erroneous.

Prevention of post harvest food losses. This is a process which involves soaking the paddy,then steaming and drying it.Parboiling improves the nutritional quality of the rice,makes the hulling operation much easier,and gives a greater proportion of whole grain white rice. The Pulp and Paper Making Processes with steam (chemical thermomechanical pulp uses chemicals and steam for pretreatment).After further refining in a second stage,the pulp is screened,cleaned,and most of the process water is removed in preparation for papermaking.Bleaching or Brightening Since the raw pulp (brown stock) still contains an appreciable amount of lignin and.
