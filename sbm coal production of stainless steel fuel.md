FACT SHEET Energy use in the steel industry 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;• The production of primary steel is more energy intensive than the production of secondary steel using scrap (see Figure 2) due to the chemical energy required to reduce iron ore to iron using carbon based reducing agents.Because reduction does not take place at room temperature,reducing agents such as coal,coke Published monthly by The Genesis of Product Making Pitch based Carbon Fiber ECOKOTE S Adopted in Fuel Tanks Investment in Cold Rolling Mill in Nigeria NSSC FW2: Highly Corrosion resistant Ferritic Stainless Steel Resumption of Delivery of Galvanized Steel Pipes The Genesis of Product Making —Raising the Added Value of Carbon Steel Production The use of EAFs has expanded and now accounts for nearly 2 3 of steel production in the United States.The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and or direct reduced iron.The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling. Data for stainless steel electric arc furnaces were taken from Outokumpu (2006),who detailed use of electricity propane,carbon monoxide,natural gas,and fuel oil.Country level stainless steel production was taken from ICDA (2006).Scrap is processed and prepared using presses,shears,bundlers,cutting,and crushing,with most of the energy.
