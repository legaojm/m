High frequency vibrating screens The purpose of the vibrating screen is that particles are introduced to the gaps in the screens repeatedly.The frequency of the screen must be high enough so that it prevents the particles from blocking the apertures and the maximum height of the particle trajectory should occur when the screen surface is at its lowest point. Circular vibrating screens Circular vibrating screens operate using indirect excitation of the screen mesh.The entire screen frame is driven by unbalance masses,which produce a circular vibrating motion.Another key feature: The directionless vibrations of the circular vibrating system have a steep launch angle and the screen area must be further tilted in order to achieve a suitable transport speed.
