Sodium Metabisulfite (E223): Uses and Side Effects in Food Sodium metabisulfite (chemical formula Na2S2O5),also called disodium,is a white yellowish crystalline powder used as an antioxidant,disinfectant,and preservative agent.It easily dissolves in water.This inorganic compound is produced by treating 70 percent. Gold cyanidation Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.[1] Production of reagents for mineral processing to. Should cyanide still be used in modern day mining? The concentration of cyanide used in processing is very diluted Toxic sodium cyanide has been used in gold mining since 1887,and it remains the primary reagent in use for gold processing today because it allows for efficient extraction of gold from low grade ore. GOLD drop from aqua regia using SMB &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;precipitation of inquarted gold dissolved in AR using SMB (sodium metabisulfite) assayed at.9999 Au 11.45g.
