The effect of ultra fine coal on the flotation behavior … Conclusions were obtained that ultra fine coal particles could adsorb more collector due to their larger specific surface area,leading to less collector left in the pulp to float silica particles.Selective flocculation reverse flotation method could increase the separation efficiency of coal reverse flotation with appropriate dosage flocculant.12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;two methods for increasing thecoal content in ultra fine coal slurry fuels have been identified and will be explored in phase i.when developed,these will increase the energy value of … Methods of Increasing the Caloriﬁ c Value of Fine Coal … 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Methods of Increasing the Caloriﬁ c Value of Fine Coal Waste.Fine grained coal waste,and particularly coal slurry and ﬂ otation tailings are used not only as low calorie fuels (independently or as an additive to commercial fuels),but also as a technologicalSize separation inefficiency in the fine particle size range of 150 μm and finer has been a perennial problem in coal preparation plants.A close examination of many plant data indicate that both quantity and quality of the clean coal product from the fine circuit of a plant may be significantly increased by improving the efficiency obtained for the size separations at and μm.
