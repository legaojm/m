Grades of Concrete with Proportion (Mix Ratio) 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grades of Concrete.Actually,what do we mean by grade of concrete.? Concrete grades are denoted by M10,M20,M30 according to their compressive strength.The “M” denotes Mix design of concrete followed by the compressive strength number in N mm 2 How calculate cement Sand and Aggregates … The main topic is to start with the water cement ratio that is the main responsible of the final concrete strenght and durability,but also the main responsible of cracking and heat generation. how many cement use for 1cum concrete for 25Grade. Answer amirthaganesan.m.M25 mix has a ratio of 1 cement to 1 sand and 2 stone jelly.i.e 1:1:2.This means cement volume is half of stone jelly volume.To prepare 1cu.m of concrete we need 0.0 cu.m of jelly.So we need 0.9 2= 0.45 cu.m of sand.So weight of cement required = 0.45x1440 =648 kg of cement.approximately 13 bags.
