Tailings Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed. Athabasca oil sands The Athabasca oil sands,also known as the Athabasca tar sands,[not verified in body] are large deposits of bitumen or extremely heavy crude oil,located in northeastern Alberta,Canada roughly centred on the boomtown of Fort McMurray.These oil sands,hosted primarily in the McMurray Formation,consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi solid rock like form of crude oil),silica sand.
