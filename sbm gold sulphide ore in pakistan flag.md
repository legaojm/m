Gold processing Britannica Gold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value.These images are derived from two properties of gold,its colour and its chemical stability.The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom,which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms. Process for recovering gold and silver from refractory ores Poor gold recovery from refractory ores is typically caused by the gold being occluded in sulfide mineral grains (usually pyrite and arsenopyrite grains) so that the gold cannot react with the cyanide leach solution or by cyanide dissolved gold being adsorbed by carbonaceous material present in the ore (this phenomenon is known as “preg. What Does Gold Ore Look Like?
