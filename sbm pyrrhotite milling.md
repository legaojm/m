Effect of Pyrite and Pyrrhotite on the Corrosive Wear … 6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Freshly abraded metal debris were magnetically attracted to pyrrhotite and lowered the rest potentials of the mineral particles,thereby affecting the corrosive wear.The investigation was extended to explore the interactions between a nonmagnetic sulfide mineral,pyrite,and abraded metal debris and their effects on the corrosive wear mechanism. Analysis of the Oxidation of Chalcopyrite,Chalcocite. ANALYSIS OF THE OXIDATION OF CHALCOPYRITE,CHALCOCITE,GALENA,PYRRHOTITE,MARCASITE,AND ARSENOPYRITE By G.W.Reimers1 and K.E.Hjelmstad2 ABSTRACT Conditions in the underground mine environment can cause self heating of sulfide ores as a result of exothermic oxidation reactions,which may result in mine fires.

Mechanochemical milling induced reactions between … The milling of arsenopyrite,pyrite and pyrrhotite in the presence of CO 2 has demonstrated that milling at room temperature induces some gas sulfide reactions.The transformation of arsenopyrite to pyrrhotite in the presence of CO 2 gas by milling is,initially,a thermally activated process in which phase changes occur in the surface layers.
