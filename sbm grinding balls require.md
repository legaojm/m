sbm grinding balls requireGrinding mills Every mining operation has a unique grinding process.Variable needs require versatile grinding equipment.Metso offers flexible autogenous (AG) mills,semi autogenous (SAG) mills,ball and pebble mills,as well as stirred mills to fit your needs. Mill (grinding) A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g. application of grinding balls Applications.The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and feldspar for pottery.Grinding can be carried out either wet or dry but the former is performed at low speed.Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls.
