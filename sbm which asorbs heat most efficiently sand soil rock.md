Specific Heat of Water vs Specific Heat of Sand Science, Part of the reason the sand got hotter faster is because the specific heat of sand is lower than the specific heat of water That’s why it took less light energy to change its temperature Going Further What other properties determine how fast a substance heats up? Try the same experiment with light and dark rock,or different types of liquids Soil and Water,what would heat faster,and what would, Apr 07,2008&#0183;&#32;In the case of sunlight being the heat source the simple answer is that soil is darker than water and thus absorbs more light and heats up faster Importantly,water has a higher specific heat,meaning it takes more heat input to cause an increase in the substances temperature,which explains this phenomenon in most other cas Why Does Sand Absorb Water? Reference Sand absorbs water because sand particles have pores in them that,when dry,are filled with air When the sand particles are wet,the air in the spores is replaced with water Sand is filled with pores that enable it to absorb water The absorbency of the sand,or the water holding capacity,depends on the texture of the grains Environmental Science 110 Final Review Flashcards Quizlet 89) The term "greenhouse effect" is derived from the fact that A) greenhouse gases act like the glass in a greenhouse B) increasing global temperatures will make the earth a better greenhouse C) green things absorb heat energy most efficiently D) the effect is caused by green plants Activity: Differential Heating of Land and Ocean Not only do the oceans cover more than 2 3 of the Earth's surface,they also absorb more sunlight and store more heat Additionally the oceans retain heat longer The Sun's rays also penetrate the oceans to a depth of many meters,but only heat up the top layer of the sand or soil THERMAL PROPERTIES OF ROCKS USGS THERMAL PROPERTIES OF ROCKS By Eugene C Robertson ABSTRACT All the important thermal properties of rocks can be estimated from the graphs and tables in this report Most of the useful published data are summarized herein to provide fairly accurate evaluations of thermal coefficients and parameters of rocks for many engineering and scientific.
