HOW TO CALCULATE CORE RECOVERY AND RQD OF ROCK, Rock Quality Designation (RQD) is a modified core recovery percentage in which the lengths of all sound rock core pieces over 100 mm in length are summed and divided by the length of the core run Pieces of core that are not hard and sound should not be included in the RQD evaluation even if they are at least 100 mm in length Rock Mass Classification Dec 22,2013&#0183;&#32;RQD (Rock Quality Designation): “RQD is the sum of length ( between natural joints ) of all core pieces more than 10 cm long as a percentage of the total core length” RQD will therefore be a percentage between 0 to 100,Stress Reduction Factor: It describes the relation between stress and rock strength around an underground opening. 1 Rock mass classification Rock quality designation index (RQD) The Rock Quality Designation index (RQD) was developed by Deere (Deere et al 1967) to provide a quantitative estimate of rock mass quality from drill core logs RQD is defined as the percentage of intact core pieces longer than 100 mm (4, Graphic1 KEY WORDS: rock mechanics,Rock Quality Designation index,modulus of deformation,jointed rock,tunnel supports,rock mass classification,core logging The Rock Quality Designation (RQD) index has been used for over 20 years as an index of rock quality It measures the percentage of "good" rock within a borehole It was developed by 0 60mm crushed aggregate Grinding Mill China 0 60mm crushed aggregate.(crushed rock,sand and gravel),co ver Revive 5 0:5 0 white 1 sided board text Revive 75 white matt.
