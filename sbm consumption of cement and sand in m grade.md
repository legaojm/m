sbm consumption of cement and sand in m gradeStrength of Concrete vs Grades of Cement 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are cases when the cements of certain grades give more than prescribed strength at 7 days and thereafter a very little gain in their strength is observed till 28 days and in some cases the strength does not reach the level as per the grade.There are also cases,where a 43 grade cement gives 28 day strength matching with 53 grade. ASSESSMENT OF COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF M40 … 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;M 40 Grade concrete using complete manufactured sand yielded an excesses strength of 7.65%,7.76% and 2.71% compared to conventional concrete for 7 days,14 days and 28 days respectively,with a reduction of.37% in slump.
