Sciencemadness Discussion Board &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Separation of Copper Nickel Alloy I really don't know where to start here,to separate copper and nickel.I have considered distilling out nickel (II) chloride while at the same time decomposing copper (II) chloride to insoluble copper (I),both of which happen at a temperature around 1000&#176;C,but I'm not even sure if this would work at all as I do not know how the nickel chloride hydrates. Cobalt extraction Cobalt extraction refers to the techniques used to extract cobalt from its ores and other compound ores.Several methods exist for the separation of cobalt from copper and nickel.They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. Extraction of Copper at Elevated Feed Concentrations 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;g L Cu adds 31 g L acid.The higher the acidity,the more the extraction reaction is inhibited.Ultimately,with more acid,stripping takes place.A solution is to use.a stronger copper extractant,one which will continue to extract copper at higher acidity,but which in turn requires more acid to be stripped.In order to extract more copper. Copper Lead Concentrate Separation At the end,the use of a sequential copper lead zinc flotation circuit produced the most efficient copper and lead separation.A bulk flotation process followed by a reverse flotation where copper was depressed and lead was floated from the bulk concentrate also produced separate concentrates,but at lower efficiency than the sequential circuit.
