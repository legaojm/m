What is a Safe Distance Between Cars? Driving Too Close &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A driver may be ticketed for “following too close,” but the law doesn’t specify exactly what constitutes a safe distance.Since the safe space between cars varies based on speed,weather conditions,and even factors such as how well maintained brakes and tires are,it is impossible to offer a concrete,easily measurable distance that will.
