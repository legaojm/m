What is Cement Clinker? Composition,Types &amp; Uses 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products.The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 25 mm and dark grey in color.It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400&#176;C &#176;C in the rotary kiln. How is cement made? Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale.These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions.This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln fee. cement clinker Combustion processes involving different types of fuels (e.g.coal,petroleum coke,fuel oil,natural gas and the broad range of waste fuels) that take place at installations for the production of cement clinker shall be monitored and reported in accordance with Annex II.
