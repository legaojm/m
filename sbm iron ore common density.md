Iron Ore Three potential sources (from the ores,sinter,or scrap) of naturally occurring radionuclides in the slag are discussed.Iron ores due to their geochemical properties scavenge radionuclides and heavy metals resulting in only trace levels of uranium in the main raw materials for iron making; iron ore and coke ranging of 20 30 Bq kg and 5 Bq kg for limestone (Cooper,2005). Difference in Weight of Steel Versus Cast Iron … Iron ores contain iron in compounds with other elements.The two most common ores are hematite,Fe2O3,and magnetite,Fe3O4.Iron is extracted from ore during smelting.The initial smelting process leaves iron with a high concentration of carbon and other impurities in it.This is cast iron. Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron containing ores.﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving behind a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) between 27 BCE.
