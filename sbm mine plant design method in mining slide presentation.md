Thyssen Mining Thyssen Mining Ground Freezing Artificial ground freezing is a construction technique utilized in poor ground conditions and or high water inflows.The Thyssen Group has used this ground stabilization method for over 100 years with the first artificial ground freeze. What are the main methods of mining? American … There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.
