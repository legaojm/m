What are the Different Types of Faults in Electrical Power … Line to line faults occur when two conductors make contact with each other mainly while swinging of lines due to winds and 10 percent of the faults are of this type.These are also called unbalanced faults since their occurrence causes unbalance in the Plants That Are Phototoxic As a response,it is manifested when chemicals contact the plant and cause it to become ill or damaged.As a defense,the plant releases its own chemicals,which can make the intruder or predator ill,known as phototoxicity.This dual effect is not found in all plants but some are more sensitive to chemicals than others.
