sbm sedimentary rock grindingfiner grinding cnki In ten of 14 leach plants surveyed,23% of the unrecovered gold could be extracted without finer grinding.Low values for rolled oats were further reduced by finer grinding.The Paddington ore is essentially free milling,and after finer grinding to account for the fine grained native gold,is processed in a CIL plant. [Solved] 5) Let's say that I grind up a DETRITAL. style=&quot;color:rgb(68,68,68);&quot;&gt; sedimentary rock and put it into a &quot;radiometric dating machine.&quot; The date obtained would probably not be particularly useful.EXPLAIN why it would be so difficult to date detrital sedimentary rocks by grinding them up and measuring parent daughter isotopic ratios. Sedimentary rock 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This is the group of processes that turns loose sediment into sedimentary rock.First there is the deposition of loose sedimentary grains,during this process the material is compacted as more sediment is put on top.The initial pore space for slow moving sediment can be about 50 percent of the sediment,in faster moving sediment this is. sedimentary rocks of dolomite,south africa ball mill.
