Types of Pavements Flexible Pavements and Rigid Pavements Types of Pavements There are two types of pavements based on design considerations ie flexible pavement and rigid pavement Difference between flexible and rigid pavements is based on the manner in which the loads are distributed to the subgrade Pavement Design in Road Construction Design Parameters, Pavement Design in Road Construction BY Kiran Biradar Introduction Pavement design is the major component in the road construction Nearly one third or one half of the total cost of construction,so careful consideration should be taken in design of pavement Theory Of Pavement Structure For Road Construction Theory Of Pavement Structure For Road Construction.We are a large scale manufacturer specializing in producing various mining machines including different types of sand and gravel equipment,milling equipment,mineral processing equipment and building materials equipment. Pavement Structure Pavement Interactive A flexible pavement structure is typically composed of several layers of material each of which receives the loads from the above layer,spreads them out,then passes them on to the layer below Thus,the further down in the pavement structure a particular layer is,the less load (in terms of force per area) it must carry (see Figure 1) Figure 1 Road Design Pavement Design Pavement Design The road pavement is the actual surface on which the vehicles will travel It's purpose is two fold,to provide friction for the vehicles and to transfer normal stresses to the underlying soils Research on Precast Block Pavement Structure Design of.
