Top 10 Countries Where Wind Turbines Are Used Most. While most of the countries using wind energy have up to now focused on wind generation on land,some of these countries using wind power are now looking at establishing off shore wind farms.The advantages of these are obvious,with land acquisition for wind farms difficult and expensive,and with wind blowing more regularly out in the sea. The Economics of Wind Energy 8 THE ECONOMICS OF WIND ENERGY Executive Summary One of the most important economic benefi ts of wind power is that it reduces the exposure of our econo mies to fuel price volatility.This benefi t is so sizable that it could easily justify a larger share of wind energy in most European countries,even if wind were more ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE STEEL SECTOR: WHY IT WORKS … benefit from energy efficiency.Beyond cost savings,energy efficiency can increase companies’ productivity and competitiveness.Nevertheless,research shows that the steel sector,in a similar fashion to all other industry sectors,does not always choose to implement energy efficiency measures,or at least not Watermill A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower.It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding),rolling,or hammering.Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods,including flour,lumber,paper,textiles,and many metal products.
