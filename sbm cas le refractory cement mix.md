What is Refractory Cement? Mid Mountain Materials High temperature masonry comes in multiple forms,from thermodynamically stable firebricks to castable refractory cement that are formulated from thermally resistant clinker and specialized aggregate materials.Conventional cements are often used in the manufacturing of fireplaces and furnaces,but they do not exhibit the requisite. Alumina Cement Suppliers Alumina cement is a kind of refractory cement which has a high temperature resistance and can withstand 1580℃.It can be used as binding agent to make monolithic refractory.It is the main type of refractory cement.To some extent,refractory cement is also called alumina cement. Castable Refractory Here we have our range of Castable refractory products,We have LOW CEMENT CASTABLE,which is ideal for applications when the lining will be under attack from chemicals such as in an incinerator.We have DENSE CASTABLE for lining kilns,forges and furnaces. 3000 Degree Castable Refractory Castable Refractory … LOUCAST 3000 Degree Castable Refractory is a dense castable refractory mortar rated for 3000˚F It is low iron content,with high purity.This refractory mortar is designed to successfully withstand high sulphur fuel,reducing atmospheres,carbon deposition,erosion and abrasion. Calcium aluminate cements Wikipedia The cement is made by fusing together a mixture of a calcium bearing material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes,or refined alumina for white and refractory cements) The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular. SECAR® range Calcium Aluminate solution for refractory Use SECAR® range products are used in refractory applications and refractory concretes combining mechanical performance with ease of installation: conventional concrete and concrete with low cement content and even with ultra low cement content The concrete can be sprayed,cast under vibration or self compacting SECAR® cements are fully compatible with the different refractory aggregates.
