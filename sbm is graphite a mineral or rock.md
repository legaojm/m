OVERVIEW Global Li Ion Graphite What is graphite? Graphite is a crystalline form of pure carbon which occurs naturally in the earths crust.When carbon rich sediments are buried under kilometers of rock over time the heat and pressure,causes the carbon atoms to arrange into a crystal form we call the mineral graphite (under extreme pressures and temperatures under hundreds of kilometers of rock,carbon atoms take the form. Graphite exploration methods Graphite exploration the. 30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Graphite exploration the importance of planning Graphite has become the focus for dozens of exploration companies since the mineral’s investment boom of 2012.Andrew Scogings,Industrial Minerals Consultant*,looks at the diferent exploration and testing methods and reporting conventions used by the graphite industry.IMX Resources Ltd What mineral group is graphite in?
