Shale Minerals Education Coalition Shale is a sedimentary rock composed of very fine clay particles.Clay forms from the decomposition of the mineral feldspar.Other minerals present in Ceramic Research Company The formation of clay is a chemical process that is assisted by mechanical breakdown and the separation of fine particles from coarse grains [5].Figure 1 : Clay mine Clays were formed by alteration,through aging and weathering of rocks such as granite,feldspar,mica and quartz. What is Sand Overview and Geology Granite is composed of feldspar (pink and white) which decomposes chemically into clay minerals.Another important constituent of granite is quartz (gray).Quartz is very resistant to chemical weathering.It does not alter to any other mineral — quartz is quartz and will remain that way.It eventually goes into solutions but VERY slowly. Weathering &amp; Clay Minerals Types of Chemical Weathering Reactions Hydrolysis H + or OH replaces an ion in the mineral.Example: Leaching ions are removed by dissolution into water.In the example above we say that the K + ion was leached.Oxidation Since free oxygen (O 2) is more common near the Earth's surface,it may react with minerals to change the oxidation state of an ion.

Chemical Weathering Processes of Change Weathering refers to the process by which rocks are broken apart or chemically altered to become sediment.Perhaps the most well known oxidation reaction is the formation of rust.Consider another reaction,the oxidation of pyroxene into limonite and dissolved silica,below:.For example,consider the mineral potassium feldspar. Clay mineral Chemical and physical properties. In nature both mineral formation mechanisms,neoformation and transformation,are induced by weathering and hydrothermal and diagenetic actions.The formation of the clay minerals by weathering processes is determined by the nature of the parent rock,climate,topography,vegetation,and the time period during which these factors operated.
