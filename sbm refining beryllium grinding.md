Beryllium Beryllium is a chemical element with the symbol Be and atomic number 4.It is a relatively rare element in the universe,usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays.Within the cores of stars,beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements.It is a divalent element. Beryllium Copper Sander Shoe &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Good Answer: I want to advise that Be beryllium is a toxic and carcinogenic material.While in a alloy with copper consider wear and tear dust as very dangerous.It is your decision.A common sander is a very poor choice of tools to try and use for precision surface.
