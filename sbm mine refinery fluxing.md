Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold When most people hear “borax” they think about laundry.But at Manhattan Gold &amp; Silver,we think about gold refining.That’s because this mineral does more than wash clothes it’s an important flux in metallurgy for separating gold from slag. Smelting Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores,including silver,iron,copper,and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore,driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

One hundred years of Australian copper smelting … T h e year 1917 was a watershed for Australian copper mining and particularly for copper smelting.Prior to this time many copper mines were equipped with an on site smelter,into which high grade copper ore or a gravity copper concentrate were fed to produce a copper matte (with 40 per cent copper) for subsequent converting to blister copper (99 per cent copper) and refining at centralised. SMELTING SILVER 5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;All silver ores need to be fluxed for smelting.6 In Pliny's day,when almost all the ore smelted was high grade,the addition of lead or lead ore (galena,PbS) was sufficient for fluxing (book XXXIII,sec.XXXI).By the time that Biringuccio and Agricola are writing in the 16th century,the art of fluxing has advanced in complexity but not in.
