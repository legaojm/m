Leica Infinity Survey Software Leica Geosystems Leica Infinity: a user friendly,intelligent software platform with intelligent information architecture that opens up previously unimagined possibilities within many aspects of your workflow.More efficiency,greater transparency and simply better. Gyrotheodolite In 1949,the gyro theodolite at that time called a &quot;meridian pointer&quot; or &quot;meridian indicator&quot; [2] was first used by the Clausthal Mining Academy underground.Several years later it was improved with the addition of autocollimation telescopes. The History Of Theodolites Reference and Education When these engineers are working underground,such as in the creation of tunnels or perhaps in mining,they use a special type of theodolite known as a gyrotheodolite,which is basically a gyroscope mounted to a theodolite.Above ground,astronomical star but.
