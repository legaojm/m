Iron Ore Beneficiation Iron Ore Beneficiation Introduction Iron Ore Beneficiation increases the grade of iron whilst maximising recovery and reduces the content of ultrafine low grade slimes to maximise return on investment from the mining process prior to sale or further refining in the iron. Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,is produced from direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets or fines) by a reducing gas produced from natural gas or coal.The reducing gas is a mixture majority of hydrogen (H2) and carbon
