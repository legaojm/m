Uranium mining (open cut and underground) and … Heap leaching is a variation of uranium ore processing applicable to open cut or underground uranium mines.The technique as currently applied was largely adapted from copper (and to a lesser extent gold) heap leaching operations (Schnell,2014; see also Van Zyl and Caldwell,2013). Solvent extraction of uranium from leach solutions. Solvent extraction of uranium from acidic and alkaline post leaching liquors that were obtained by leaching of Polish ores is reported in this paper.The stripping of uranium from organic to aqueous phase was also studied.The synergistic mixture of diethylhexylphosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and tri n butylphosphate (0.2 M:0.2 M) was found as a good extracting agent for uranium.
