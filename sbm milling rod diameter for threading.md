sbm milling rod diameter for threadingrod size to thread size chart The Hobby Machinist &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;was wondering if they make a chart that tells you the rod size that you would need to cut a known thread.i want to be ably to make my own bolts minus the head or threaded rod:thinking: i know i'm thinking again lol ty tony understand,you cant take a 1 4 inch rod Turning small,slender parts &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If you have to turn slender parts,the problem is that multi path turning will weaken the part and it will bend under the cutting forces.The trick (certainly NOT my invention),ist to cut the. chart for rod diameter for threading? &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This question may seem very elementary to many here,but I've been trying to find some kind of chart that will tell me what the starting diameter of a rod should be for threading with any given size die.For example,I learned the hard way that a 1 20 die really. Threading 6061 Aluminum &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;On &quot;production&quot; aluminum threading we have gone to T9,it is similar in corrosion resistance as 6061 so it's better than the 20xx stuff and still cuts well.The 6262 is more money than 6061 and less distributors carry it,but we get screw machine stock in Large Spindle Cnc Pipe Threading Lathe Qk1319 Cnc Lathe … Large Spindle Cnc Pipe Threading Lathe Qk1319 Cnc Lathe For Pipe Threaded With Double Chuck Big.and the spindle box has chucks before and after,in order to facilitate the clamping and processing of large diameter pipes and rods.Can turn metric.
