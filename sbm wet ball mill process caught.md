Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear. Correlation between process parameters and milling efficiency Correlation between process parameters and milling efficiency Anna Johansson An experimental ball milling study was performed to compare the deagglomeration behavior and the evolution of the particle size distribution with increasing milling time of two relatively coarse WC powders used for the production of cemented carbide cutting tools. Wet Grinding With a comminution factor down to 1 : 10 000 (200 Œºm &gt; 20 nm),the application range is extensive and the variety of tasks extremely diverse.The wetting and homogenization of solids in liquids,deagglomeration and dispersion,all the way to true comminution of primary particles make the agitator bead mill a universal wet processing machine.
