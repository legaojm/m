Flavourings Production,Composition,Applications. These methods are relatively simple and can be carried out in a number of ways.For trial purposes on the laboratory scale,maceration is called for.The raw material is ground with special mills.Depending on feed material,crushing,grinding or cutting processes are appropriate [9]. www.up.lublin.pl 15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;AnimAl nutrition Seventh Edition P.McDonald R.A.Edwards J.F.D.Greenhalgh C.A.Morgan L.A.Sinclair R.G.Wilkinson Anim A l n utrition www.pearson books.com.

Report 14 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;methods of samPlIng The need to obtain a representative sample deserves special attention since a wrong sampling plan can greatly affect the reliability of the measured levels.Sampling is one of the steps that contribute to the variability of analyses due to nonhomogeneous nature of most chemical hazard distribution in food and feed. ORGANIZING COMMITTEE For grinding,the crushed coal is then send to a hammer mill,which operates at 2800rpm to achieve fine pulverization of up to 75 microns,The finely pulverized coal is now to be distributed into a range of different sizes,ranging between 212microns 75microns by a vibratory sieve. Development Document for Effluent Limitations … Screening sampling visits were conducted during 1977 to sites within the various subcategories as listed in Table V l.All sampling and analysis during this phase were done according to EPA sampling protocols.(8).After review of screen sampling analytical results,several additional sites were selected for verification sampling.
