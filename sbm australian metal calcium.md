Calcium and Magnesium in Drinking water 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;calcium and magnesium are well established but quantitatively imprecise.Many of the ecological epidemiological studies conducted since the mid s have supported the hypothesis that extra magnesium and or calcium in drinking water can contribute to reduced cardiovascular disease and other health benefits in populations.Types of meteorites.Depending on how much metal or stony silicate material is present,meteorites can be irons,stony irons,or stones.These may represent the centre (irons),inner (stony irons) and outer parts (stone) of small planetary bodies which collided and broke up in the asteroid belt,or material that failed to clump together to make planetary bodies when the Solar System first formed.
