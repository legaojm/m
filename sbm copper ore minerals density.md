Copper processing Extraction and refining The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps.The first step,mineral processing,is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents—such as alumina,limestone,pyrite,and silica—so that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing between 20 and 30 percent copper. Copper Geoscience Australia The ore is then ground finely before the copper bearing sulfide minerals are concentrated by a flotation process which separates the grains of ore mineral from the waste material,or gangue.Depending on the type of copper bearing minerals in the ore and the treatment processes used,the concentrate typically contains between 25 and 30% copper,however may be as high as approximately 60% copper.
