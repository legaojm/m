Gold Metallurgy &amp; Leaching in Cyanicides Cyanidation as applied to ordinary gold and silver ores is a relatively simple process.When cyanicides {cyanide consuming elements) are encountered in small amounts in the treatment of such ores,the various schemes already discussed,such as use of a lead salt or wasting barren solution,can usually be resorted to and successful operation maintained. The use of cyanide in gold mining The cyanide trickles down through the ore and bonds with microscopic specks of gold.A pad underlying the heap channels the solution into a holding pond.The gold laden cyanide solution flows over activated carbon; the carbon bonds to the gold while the cyanide is drawn off for re use on the heap.
