SUBJECT: Blasting Notification Requirements for Quarries persons who may be present on property adjacent to the blasting area.” WV Rules at 6.3 requires in part that “… prior to blasting operations,written notification of blasting operations…shall be delivered in person or by certified mail to each residence and GUIDANCE ON THE SAFE USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN QUARRIES procedures and the site,as far as that relates to the safe use of explosives; and f) There needs to be good communication and co ordination between them,for example to deal with any handover or maintenance issues.2.Blasting contractors The operator may Abrasive Blasting: Code of Practice ABRASIVE BLASTING Code of Practice OCTOBER 2012 Safe Work Australia is an Australian Government statutory agency established in 2009.Safe Work Australia consists of representatives of the Commonwealth,state and territory.
