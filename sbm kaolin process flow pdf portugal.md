Thermal behavior of the kaolin minerals NIST Page effect is due to the dissociation of the kaolin minerals into water vapor and an intimate mixture of amorphous Ah03.platinum cylinder,a Pt Rh to Pt to Pt Rh differential thermocouple,and a type K potentiometer were.sociation process assists very little in answering the question as to the nature of the dissociation process&nbsp;. Calcined Kaolin Notes Calcined kaolin is a powdered white non plastic material.It is raw kaolin that has been fired (in a rotary calcining kiln) high enough to remove the 12% (approx) crystal water.If you are a potter you can make your own calcined kaolin by simply bisque firing any raw powdered kaolin (in a small enough bisque vessel and slow enough ramp that the heat penetrates well).
