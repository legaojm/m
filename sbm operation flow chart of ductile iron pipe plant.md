Why Is it Important to Know the OD ID of Ductile Iron … What is Outside Diameter? The Outside Diameter (OD) of a circular object,such as a pipe,is the measurement of the distance of a straight line from one point on the outer wall of the pipe,let’s say the 12 o’clock position,through the pipe’s center to an opposite point on the outside; in this case,the 6 o’clock position.inch Ductile iron pipe (DI pipe) has a nominal OD of 25.80.
